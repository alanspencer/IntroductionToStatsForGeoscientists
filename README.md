# Introduction To Statistics For Geoscientists
This is a 1st year undergraduate course for geoscientists taught by [Alan Spencer](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/alan.spencer) at [Imperial College London](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/earthscienceandengineering) as part of the Graphics and Statistics module. Much of this course material is based on previous lectures by [Gerard Gorman] (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman). The course has two objectives:
* Learn the basic principles of computer programming. This understanding will form the basis for learning many other programming languages.
* Become proficient at Python programming as it is currently one of the most commonly used languages in computational science.
